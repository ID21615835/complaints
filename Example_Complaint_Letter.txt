Dear Mr. Smith:

Re: Broken sofa

On February 5,, 2017 I bought a sofa, model number 25811, serial number 850599-4204 at the Furniture Gallery and Showroom located at 1834 W. Elm Ave. Town, TX 77001. I paid $650.00 for the sofa on my credit card. Furniture Gallery delivered the sofa to my home on February 12, 2017.

Unfortunately, your product has not performed well because the sofa is defective. I am disappointed because one of the legs broke off on February 28, 2017. The sofa is unsteady and rocks while I sit on it, so it is not comfortable or relaxing. I have not used this sofa in a way that would cause any damage. I returned to the store on March 3 and March 5 but the store manager, Aaron, would not speak to me.

To resolve the problem, I would appreciate if your company would pick up this sofa, for free, and refund the $650 I paid. Enclosed are copies of my records, including my receipt, delivery invoice, and photos of the broken sofa.

I look forward to your reply and a resolution to my problem and will wait until April 5, 2017 before seeking help from a consumer protection agency or Better Business Bureau. Please contact me at the above address or by phone at (281-555-1234).

Sincerely,


Morgan Wilson
